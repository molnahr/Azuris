## Introduction
Nowadays people are tending to play a lot of games as relaxation. Theese games 
can help users to relieve stress and meantime they can improve their functional abilities 
such as concentration, reflexes, perceptibility, fast-thinking.
Thanks to the presence of oodles game developing environments every year tons 
of new indie(independent video game) games appears. Despite of this huge amount new 
games the host community is far greater which means a lot of potential for new game 
developers.
There are plenty environment to build up a game but we decided to use Unity 
because it has a lot of prebuilt features which can facilitate the developing experience.
Unity gives users the ability to create games and experiences in both 2D and 3D, and the 
engine offers a primary scripting API in C#, for both the Unity editor in the form of 
plugins, and games themselves, as well as drag and drop functionality.

## Targets
We would like to develope a game which deviates from usual game controls and 
gives a better user experience. The most important matter is to place the user in a magical 
world like he would be the character at Hogwarts in Harry Potter. The target would be to 
give an experience where the user could create the spellâ€™s conjuring motion.
Furthermore the basic goals are the similar as the usual games, such as exciting, 
improving brain functionalities and memorie...
